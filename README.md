This is my university project. This project aims to create a convenient digital character sheet for TTRPGs such as D&D, Cyberpunk, and Vampire: The Masquerade, but will initially support only D&D sheets. Don't have high expectations for this project, as it's primarily for study, but I admit it could become more.

I know there are already some online sheets, but I hope mine will provide cooler stuff somewhere in the future.
